I've been navigating my way through the task of teaching myself how to code in part thanks to these [trail maps](https://github.com/thoughtbot/trail-map) that Thoughtbot has assembled.  I used them as a base and cooked up my own map.  I'm going to call it a road map because I don't ski or hike really.  And roads take you places while trails do not usually have a destination.

So here, first of all, is my [Ruby road map](blog/2012/09/14/road-map-no-1-ruby).  I'm going to add items to the list when I encounter them, and cross off what I've achieved.
