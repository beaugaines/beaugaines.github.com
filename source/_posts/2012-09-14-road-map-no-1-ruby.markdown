Not yet in strict order, here's my list:

- finish *The Well-Grounded Rubyist* _(update: on page 335)_
- finish *Ruby Koans*
- go through the APIs for Ruby **Array—ã, Hashes, Strings, and Files**.  Learn 'em by heart
- read chaps. 23 and 34 of *The Pickaxe*
- read *Practical Projects in Ruby*
- read *Metaprogramming in Ruby*
