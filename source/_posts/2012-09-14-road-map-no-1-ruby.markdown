Not yet in strict order, here's my list:

1. Go through the APIs for Ruby **Array—ã, Hashes, Strings, and Files**  Learn 'em by heart
2. Finish *The Well-Grounded Rubyist*
3. Finish *Ruby Koans*
4. Read chaps. 23 and 34 of *The Pickaxe*
5. Read *Practical Projects in Ruby*
6. Read *Metaprogramming in Ruby*
