I haven't posted here in ages.  I've been busy polishing up my first real app - a Rails clone of Stashboard.  I'm pretty happy with the results.  I managed to get a version with responsive tables working.  Just some styling tweaks and some sort of admin dashboard remain to be done.  And deployment.  I'm hoping for the end of next week at the latest.

Have also been making good progress through _The Well-Grounded Rubyist_.  I found it a bit dry at first but it's grown on me a lot.  Just finished the chapter on `Enumerable` - very interesting - and am now working through the `regexp` chapter.  Heaven!  I've always loved regexps.  I don't understand why people find them so distasteful.  In his preface to the chapter David Black says some people believe them to be 'counterproductive'.  I don't understand what he means by that...but I'll look into it.

Anyway...unproductive or not, I'm really enjoying it.  I'm looking forward to finishing the rest of the book and moving on to _Metaprogramming in Ruby_.  Then I'm gonna dig into Javascript.  I have a lot to learn on that front.  I wish it were more likeable as a language.  But it's indispensible it seems...so I'll take the plunge.
