Whew!  The last couple months have been so busy, I've had no time to write here at all.  It's been a good period in terms of pushing ahead with my goals.  I finished working my way through _The Well-Grounded Rubyist_, and am now half-way through _The Pickaxe_, which I'm really enjoying.  I'm also half way through [Rebuilding Rails](http://rebuilding-rails.com/), which I'm also enjoying.  And I'm also reading [The S3 Cookbook](https://leanpub.com/thes3cookbook) - which is also very interesting!

I'm in the midst of polishing up and deploying my Stashboard clone - and will post the link to that soon.  I learned a lot on that project.  A couple other Rails projects are nearing fruition as well.

My goal for this year is really to just continue my current trajectory and get more and broader and deeper knowledge of every part of the Rails stack.  But I plan on redoubling my efforts on the Javascript front.  I have a backlog of books to read:  _Node in Action_, _Master Time and Space with Javascript_, _Extending jQuery_, _CoffeeScript in Action_, and _Secrets of the Javascript Ninja_ -- among others!

I also need to read _Redis in Action_ and I want to build an app with MongoDB.  I'm also reviewing a manuscript for Manning - [PostGIS in Action](http://www.manning.com/obe/).  I'm always glad to increase my Postgres skills so that should be interesting.

So...I have my work cut out for me.  Luckily I enjoy this stuff.  I buy new programming books with unvarnished glee.  I just wish I had more time to work through them all.  They'll keep coming this year - the tide of books is relentless - but I will soldier on - and much will be learned!

It will be a good year of coding I think...
