#### How I plan to conquer the world in three short months

Winter has about two and a half months left in it, and by the time it is out I plan to have conquered the world.  Here's the plan:

- finish _The Pickaxe_.  I'm nearly there.
- read _Metaprogramming in Ruby_.  Looking forward to that.
- finish _Rebuilding Rails_.  Good fun so far.
- see through Coursera's [ML/Racket/Ruby course](https://www.coursera.org/course/proglang)
- read three or so Javascript books; maybe _Extending jQuery_, _Secrets of the Javascript Ninja_, and _Node in Action_.
- if I have time, read _Redis in Action_.  And maybe _Mongo in Action_.
- do two more solid apps of my own - hopefully each one better than the last.

I'm also half way through a book on _Sinatra_ and anothr on testing Javascript with Jasmine.  If I can finish all this stuff I will be a happy man...and a much better developer too...
