###Ugh.

I have not posted here in far too long - which I'm not happy about - although I feel like I read this on someone's blog nearly every day, so at least I'm not alone.  I've been super busy of late:  working on my learning objectives for the year, upgrading my Javascript skills, and upgrading my coding skills full stop - thanks to the _EdX 6.00_ course from MIT. <!-- more -->  It's nominally _Intro to Comp. Sci_, so some of it is review, but I've never encountered a better taught course anywhere I've studied and it's really solidified my grounding in the topic.  I have some more work to do before I fully grasp amortized cost analysis, but Big O notation is fairly well-lodged in the noggin I think.  Most important thing:  I'm really enjoying the study and the better I get at programming the happier I am doing it.

Apart from the MIT course, here are my immediate goals for the next couple months:

- Eloquent Javascript (half way through!)
- Manning SPA book
- Rebuilding Rails
- CoffeeScript in Action
- MongoDB in Action

In addition I have a new Rails project I want to work on - a tool for private tutors and teachers.  So many projects, so little time...
